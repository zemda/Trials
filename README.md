# Trials

## Gameplay Mechanics
Navigate through intricate levels using these mechanics:

### Grappling Hook
- **Activated with Left Mouse Button**
- Attachable to specific blue line "points" starting from Level 03. Points might have some chance to be only one time use

### Attachable Rope
- **Triggered by pressing the E Key**
- Not all ropes are attachable -> spot the difference through subtle texture details

### Portals
- There's a chance, that they will either move you forward or not...

## Controls
- **Move using WASD or Arrow Keys**
- **Grappling Hook**: Left Mouse Button
- **Rope Attachment**: E Key
- **Skip Level**: ESC Key (temporary until full version)
- *All controls can be modified in the settings*

## Leaderboard System
- Powered by Talo
- Tracks best times per level and continuous run
- Only randomly generated player names :(

## Notes
- Skipping levels will prevent time tracking
- Clearing cache resets your account (pls don't)
- Only the best times are saved into leaderboard (online leaderboard UI might be buggy)
- It is meant to be hard

## Assets
- Tileset from [uheartbeast](https://github.com/uheartbeast)
- Level background music generated via Suno

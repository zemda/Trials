# Trials

## Gameplay Mechanics
Navigate through intricate levels using these mechanics:

### Grappling Hook
- **Activated with Left Mouse Button**
- Attachable to specific blue line "points" starting from Level 03 (till then can be used to detect collisions...). 
- Points might have some chance to be only one time use

### Attachable Rope
- **Triggered by pressing the E Key**
- Not all ropes are attachable -> spot the difference through subtle texture details

### Portals
- There's a chance, that they will either move you forward or not...

## Controls
- **Move using WASD or Arrow Keys**
- **Grappling Hook**: Left Mouse Button
- **Rope Attachment**: E Key
- **Skip Level**: ESC Key (temporary until full version)
- *All controls can be modified in the settings*

## Leaderboard System
- Powered by Talo
- Tracks best times per level and continuous run
- Only randomly generated player names :( (saved in user://)

## Notes
- Skipping levels will prevent time tracking
- Clearing cache resets your account (pls don't)
- Only the best times are saved into leaderboard
- **Hint**: In Level 02, use enemy explosions to your advantage

## Assets
- Tileset from uheartbeast
- *Sounds are missing, some effects/animations might be incomplete*
- *UI is not perfectly aligned, leaderboard might be buggy*
